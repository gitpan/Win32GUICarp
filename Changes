Revision history for Perl extension Win32::GUI::Carp.

Version 1.01 (April 23, 2003)
  Release to CPAN on May 11, 2004

  Added $FatalFilter and $WarningFilter

Version 1.0 (October 25, 2002)
  Adapted from Tk::Carp

  Fixed bug where calling windie or winwarn with
  messages that didn't end in a newline would report the wrong
  line number (ie, inside Win32::GUI::Carp).

  Fixed bug where warningsToDialog was ignored by warnings
  generated in old / chained __WARN__ and __DIE__ handlers.

  Fixed bug where immediateWarnings was ignored by warnings
  generated in old / chained __WARN__ handlers.
