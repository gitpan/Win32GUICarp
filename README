Win32::GUI::Carp version 1.01
=============================

When Perl programs are run in a GUI environment, it is often desirable
to have them run with no console attached.  Unfortunately, this causes
any warnings or errors to be lost.  Worse, fatal errors can cause your
program to silently disappear, forcing you to restart the program,
attached to a console, and hope you can reproduce the error.

This module makes it easy to see any errors or warnings your
console-less program might produce by catching any errors and/or
warnings and displaying them in a pop-up dialog box using Win32::GUI.
It is similar in spirit to CGI::Carp's fatalsToBrowser and
warningsToBrowser special import directives.
